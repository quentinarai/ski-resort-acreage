Comparison of ski resort acreage 

This program is intended as a first forray into personal projects.

I am intending to create a python program that can compare acreage of different ski resorts and store them in a dictionary. 
The home resort for comparison will be Vail Mountain, in Vail Colorado.
This mountain was selected because it is currently my home mountain. 

My intent is to allow the user to input a list of resorts they have been too and have the program respond with a proper comparison dictionary.
